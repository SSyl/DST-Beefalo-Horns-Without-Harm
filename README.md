# DST-Beefalo Horns Without Harm

For Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together

## Disclaimer

I created this mod back in 2016. It still works, although it definitely needs updating to be kept with Don't Starve Together's latest modding standards. That said, using it won't break anything in your game.

## Quick Description

This mod gives the razor a chance to drop Beefalo Horns when shaving Beefalo. The percent change is customizable.

## Full Description

This mod lets you get Beefalo Horns without having to kill the Beefalo. It does this by having a very low (although customizable) percent chance to drop a horn when shaved.

You may be asking yourself, why would a Beefalo horn drop when you shave them?
Well, Beefalo horns are always growing and need occasional grooming. Sometimes, during the grooming process, the old molted horn happens to come loose as the new horn comes in.

And there you have it, Beefalo Horns with no harm to our majestic Beefalo friends.
